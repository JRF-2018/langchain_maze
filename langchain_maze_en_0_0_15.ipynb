        "# Bear-Sword Maze Problem with LangChain 1.x\n",
        "\n",
        "(Version: 0.0.15.4)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "`MemoryBanditWorkflow` is an agent framework created based on experiences with the Bear-Sword Maze problem. It has now been updated to support LangChain 1.x. Furthermore, I have introduced `subtool_do`, which serves as an equivalent to features like \"skills\" or \"toolboxes\" in other frameworks.\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Idea of MemoryBanditWorkflow\n",
        "\n",
        "Recently, the term \"Context Engineering\" has become prominent in the LLM space. LLMs used via APIs (rather than a web interface) are inherently \"stateless\" and do not remember past conversations by default. To maintain a conversation, the user must record messages and provide them to the API each time. To recall older information, a search infrastructure is required beyond simple logging. These components are generally referred to as \"Context,\" and how to effectively construct this context has become a key challenge.\n",
        "\n",
        "Specifically, the infrastructure for storage within the context is often simply called \"Memory.\" While this can be confusing as it overlaps with the term for PC hardware RAM, that is the standard terminology.\n",
        "\n",
        "Exasperated by the fact that agents often fail to use memory functions effectively, in my previous iteration, I created a \"Bandit\" feature—essentially a tool to register specific tools into a multi-armed bandit—allowing the AI itself to decide which tools to prioritize or use more frequently to force memory utilization. This time, I have extended that to allow for the execution of entire workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "The trajectory of this idea is documented below (in Japanese):\n",
        "\n",
        "\\[cocolog:95619779\\] (September 2025)  \n",
        "《\"Experimental Implementation of a Bandit Machine to Force LLM Memory Usage\" and \"Experimental Implementation of LLM Memory and Bandit Functions.\" The latter is the main deliverable—a framework extended from the concept of forcing increased memory usage. - A Note from JRF》  \n",

        "\n",
        "Basically, this project uses the familiar Bear-Sword Maze problem but utilizes memory functions, bandit functions, and the newly added workflow functions. While the maze problem is simple, the implementation of the memory, bandit, and workflow features is quite robust.\n",
        "\n",
        "Since implementing backends like semantic search from scratch is tedious, I have the AI \"simulate a database\" to handle the backend logic.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "I suspect similar methods already exist elsewhere, as \"Workflows\" are a well-worn concept. This may not be a particularly novel approach, but I hope this attempt serves as a useful reference.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## The Idea of \"Sub-tools\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Claude Code is already making waves as a potential step toward AGI. I wonder how it handles implementations like my `MemoryBanditWorkflow`, where a \"harness\" or constraint is applied to memory usage.\n",
        "\n",
        "Presumably, it would involve having Claude Code implement an agent with memory constraints as a sub-agent. For something written by an AI like Claude Code, a framework like `MemoryBanditWorkflow` seems particularly effective.\n",
        "\n",
        "In tools like Claude Code, there is a concept called \"skills.\" My understanding is that this is based on the idea that because MCP (Model Context Protocol) and other tool information can become bloated, it is inefficient to keep them in the context at all times; instead, required skills are \"discovered\" from a skill tree as needed.\n",
        "\n",
        "I wanted to incorporate these \"skills\" into `MemoryBanditWorkflow`. But how?\n",
        "\n",
        "In Claude Code's implementation, skills are presented as commands or code, assuming the agent can execute shell or Python scripts. However, for a \"harnessed\" agent, allowing general shell or REPL access is usually out of the question. On the other hand, if you don't allow that, you have no choice but to prepare all tools in advance, which \"pollutes\" the context.\n",
        "\n",
        "That’s when I came up with the idea of \"Sub-tools.\" The only tool visible in the context is `subtool_do`. To find out which sub-tools are available, the agent must use `subtool_show` to read documents (similar to reading a `SKILL.md`) as needed. This allows for \"on-demand learning\" while maintaining infinite scalability.\n",
        "\n",
        "The question was whether an LLM (specifically Gemini) could understand this approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "The trajectory of this idea is documented below (in Japanese):\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "  * Updated to support LangChain 1.x. Initially, handling type errors caused by the specific implementations of Pydantic v2 and Gemini was difficult, but it is now operational. However, these are stopgap measures, and I am not entirely confident about future stability.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Introduced `subtool_do` and `subtool_show` for storing tools and using them only after reading their descriptions. What is displayed by `subtool_show` is roughly equivalent to what would be written in `SKILL.md` in other frameworks.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * Translated the entire interface and documentation into English for this version.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "To avoid excessive costs, I did not intend to let the agent reach the goal from the start; I ended the experiment once a workflow was utilized. Testing was performed with gemini-2.5-flash-lite, and the final execution was requested of gemini-3-flash-preview.\n",
        "\n",
        "While Flash-Lite occasionally struggled with executing sub-tools, Gemini-3 seemed to handle them properly. My assessment is that the sub-tools worked reasonably well.\n",

            "Google’s **Gemini** is a family of highly advanced multimodal large language models developed by Google DeepMind. It was designed to succeed the PaLM 2 model and is integrated into various Google products (like the Gemini chatbot and Google Workspace).\n",
            "\n",
            "Here are the key features and characteristics of the Gemini model:\n",
            "\n",
            "### 1. Native Multimodality\n",
            "Unlike many other AI models that are trained on text and then \"bolted on\" to vision or audio tools, Gemini was built to be **multimodal from the start.**\n",
            "*   **Integrated Understanding:** It was trained simultaneously on text, images, video, audio, and code.\n",
            "*   **Cross-Modal Reasoning:** It can seamlessly understand and reason across different formats. For example, you can show it a video of a physics experiment and ask it to explain the formulas involved.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. Model Family (Sizes)\n",
            "Gemini is offered in several sizes to suit different needs, ranging from massive data centers to mobile devices:\n",
            "*   **Gemini Ultra:** The largest and most capable model, designed for highly complex tasks (reasoning, coding, and nuance).\n",
            "*   **Gemini Pro:** A versatile, mid-sized model optimized for scaling across a wide range of tasks. This is what powers the free version of the Gemini chatbot.\n",
            "*   **Gemini Flash:** A lightweight model designed for speed and efficiency, offering low latency at a lower cost.\n",
            "*   **Gemini Nano:** The most efficient model, built to run **on-device** (e.g., on Pixel 8/9 or Samsung S24) without needing an internet connection.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. Massive Context Window\n",
            "One of Gemini’s most significant competitive advantages (specifically in the **1.5 Pro and Flash** versions) is its massive context window:\n",
            "*   **Up to 1 Million to 2 Million Tokens:** It can process massive amounts of information in a single prompt.\n",
            "*   **Practical application:** This allows the model to read thousands of lines of code, digest a 1,500-page document, or \"watch\" an hour-long video and answer specific questions about it.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. Advanced Coding Capabilities\n",
            "Gemini is highly proficient in programming:\n",
            "*   It understands, explains, and generates high-quality code in popular languages like Python, Java, C++, and Go.\n",
            "*   It can assist with debugging and optimizing complex software architectures.\n",
            "*   **AlphaCode 2:** Google uses a specialized version of Gemini to power AlphaCode 2, which excels at competitive programming and complex math.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 5. High-Level Reasoning and Logic\n",
            "Gemini was designed to outperform previous models in \"common sense\" reasoning and mathematical logic.\n",
            "*   **MMLU (Massive Multitask Language Understanding):** Gemini Ultra was the first model to outperform human experts on the MMLU, which tests a combination of world knowledge and problem-solving across 57 subjects.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 6. Integration with Google Ecosystem\n",
            "Gemini is deeply woven into the tools people use daily:\n",
            "*   **Google Workspace:** It can summarize emails in Gmail, draft documents in Docs, and analyze data in Sheets.\n",
            "*   **Google Search:** It powers \"AI Overviews\" in search results.\n",
            "*   **Android:** Gemini is replacing Google Assistant as the primary AI on Android devices.\n",
            "*   **Vertex AI:** For developers, Gemini is available via Google Cloud to build custom enterprise applications.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 7. Performance and Speed\n",
            "*   **Efficiency:** Gemini 1.5 Pro is built using a **\"Mixture-of-Experts\" (MoE)** architecture. Instead of running the entire neural network for every prompt, it only activates the most relevant pathways, making it faster and more efficient than older, dense models.\n",
            "\n",
            "### 8. Safety and Ethics\n",
            "Google emphasizes that Gemini underwent rigorous safety testing, including:\n",
            "*   **Red-teaming:** Testing the model for biases, hate speech, and \"jailbreak\" attempts.\n",
            "*   **Responsibility Filters:** Built-in safeguards to prevent the generation of harmful or illegal content.\n",
            "\n",
            "### Summary: Gemini vs. GPT-4\n",
            "While both are top-tier AI models, Gemini’s primary \"killer feature\" is its **context window size** (being able to ingest entire libraries of data at once) and its **native multimodality**, which makes its video and audio processing feel more fluid and integrated than its competitors.\n"

The AI must manage unknown map locations (\\'？\\') at (1, 4) and (7, 4) using a surrounding map tool and maintain a consistent navigation policy and plan using designated memory IDs.\\n\\n## SUMMARY\\nThe AI has identified the core spatial parameters of the maze and the coordinates for the start, goal, and unknown squares. \\n- **Coordinates:** Start is (4, 1), Goal is (7, 8). Unknowns are at (1, 4) and (7, 4).\\n- **Current State:** The AI is currently at (4, 1). The goal has not been reached.\\n- **Action History:** The AI attempted to retrieve map data and procedures from memory (9999, 9998, 9997). The user has explicitly prompted the AI to use `memory_read` to access `memory:9997`.\\n- **Strategy:** The AI will use a combination of a \"Full Map\" for pathfinding and a \"Surrounding Map\" to resolve unknown squares.

The AI must use a provided full map and a surrounding map tool to handle unknown locations ('？') and reach the destination efficiently.\\n\\n## SUMMARY\\nThe AI has initialized the task and identified the coordinate system and key locations. \\n- **Coordinates:** Start (4, 1), Goal (7, 8), Unknowns at (1, 4) and (7, 4).\\n- **Environment:** 9x10 grid (Width x Height).\\n- **Current Status:** The AI is currently at the start position (4, 1). A surrounding map check shows walls ('■') to the north and open paths ('□') to the south.\\n- **Decision Making:** The AI attempted to retrieve procedures and map data from specific memory IDs (9999, 9998, 9997). The user has explicitly instructed the AI to use `memory_read` to access `memory:9997`.\\n\\n## ARTIFACTS\\n- **Full Map Layout:**\\n  ```\\n  ■■■■■■■■■ (y=0)\\n  ■■■■Ｓ■■■■ (y=1)\\n  ■□□□□□□□■ (y=2)\\n  ■□■■■■■□■ (y=3)\\n  ■？■■■■■？■ (y=4)\\n  ■□■■■■■■■ (y=5)\\n  ■□■■■□□□■ (y=6)\\n  ■□□□□□■□■ (y=7)\\n  ■■■■■■■Ｇ■ (y=8)\\n  ■■■■■■■■■ (y=9)\\n  ```\\n- **Memory IDs:** 9999 (Full Map), 9998 (Procedures), 9997 (Procedures).\\n\\n## NEXT STEPS\\n1. Use the `memory_read` tool to access `memory:9997` as requested.\\n2. Retrieve and confirm information from `memory:9998` and `memory:9999`.\\n3. Plan a path from (4, 1) to (7, 8), determining if exploration of (1, 4) or (7, 4) is necessary.\\n4.

To reach the goal, the agent must first retrieve a sword \\'△\\' from (7, 4) to defeat a bear \\'◎\\' blocking the path at (1, 4).\\n\\n## SUMMARY\\nThe agent is currently at (6, 2) following the \"Sword Retrieval\" strategy. Recent activity focused on information gathering and tool troubleshooting. The agent read `memory:1002`, which specifies that once the bear is defeated, memory write frequency should be reduced and the periodic display of that specific memory should be disabled. The agent also read `memory:9998`, which outlines the standard procedure for memory searching: expressing thought, imagining keywords, and then performing a search. Previous attempts to move to (7, 2) were hindered because the `memory_update_string` tool was identified as invalid and the `/maze_game/command` tool was reported as unavailable. \\n\\n## ARTIFACTS\\n- **Memory 9999**: Contains the full 9x10 map grid and legend.\\n- **Memory 1003 (Plan and Policy)**: Tracks navigation; current position is (6, 2).\\n- **Memory 9998**: Procedure for memory search (Thought -> Keywords -> Search).\\n- **Memory 1002**: Instructions for post-bear defeat operations (reduce write frequency).\\n- **Scratchpad**: Stores critical coordinates: Sword (7, 4), Bear (1, 4), and Goal (7, 8).\\n\\n## NEXT STEPS\\n1. Resolve the availability of `/maze_game/command` or identify an alternative method to execute movement.\\n2. Navigate to (7, 2), then to (7, 4).\\n3. Execute \"pick up Item\" at (7, 4) to acquire the sword \\'△\\'.\\n4. Navigate to (1, 4) to \"fight bear\".\\n5. Following the bear\\'s defeat, implement memory write reductions as per `memory:1002`.\\n6. Navigate to the final goal \\'Ｇ\\' at (7, 8).' additional_kwargs={'lc_source': 'summarization'} response_metadata={} id='9ef744b4-c869-498b-9452-07ed5992d6f3'\n",
